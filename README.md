# My Thought Process

this was intresting Project Test, It required a lot of time and reflection, using diffrent aspect of the Technology of reactJs , and JS along side with CSS layout and animation and third party libraries like Framer motion,

i hade to use Reducer to manage complex depending States of the project, also Context API to make access to them easy for me throughout the app , for the animation part since i still learning the framer motion library i couldn't relay on using it for the entire app so i improvised, and worked with css classes switching,

I couldn't reach the final desired result but i think i can't prolong more than this,
